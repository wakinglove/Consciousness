# Chapter 2: The RIGGS Blueprint
*Pages 4-15*

## The 5 Essential Checkpoints

**What RIGGS Actually Is:**
- NOT a conversational technique you use alone
- IS the structural architecture that makes transformation modalities complete

---

## R - RECOGNIZE

**Function:** Identify current state and vector direction

**Key Principle:** The bottleneck IS the level (not the peaks)

### Linguistic Detection

Listen to their EXACT words (not how they "seem"):

| Level | Language Markers |
|-------|------------------|
| L1 | "I can't..." (helpless, victim) |
| L2 | "It sucks that..." / "They..." (blame, friction) |
| L3 | "I accept..." (observer, neutral) |
| L4 | "I appreciate..." (gratitude, curiosity) |
| L5 | "I'm happy that..." (flow, receiving) |
| L6 | "I feel unstoppable..." (creator, ecstatic action) |

### Critical Distinction: External vs Internal Reference

- **External Reference** = "I'll be happy WHEN [circumstance changes]" (Level 1-2 trap)
- **Internal Reference** = "I'm at peace REGARDLESS of [circumstance]" (Level 3-6 freedom)

### Temporal Markers

- Use **PAST TENSE** to acknowledge Level 1-2: "You were feeling stuck..."
- This softens/weakens the negative state
- Don't lock them IN the pattern with present tense

### Entropy State Assessment

RECOGNIZE now includes:
- Entropy state assessment (not just level)
- Vector quality diagnosis
- Loop detection markers

## I - INTERRUPT

**Function:** Break biochemical/energetic momentum

**Key Principle:** Mental reframing alone is insufficient — physical interrupt required

### Why This Matters

- Can't think your way out of a thinking problem
- Level 1-2 states create stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) with momentum
- Mental shift without somatic shift = temporary, collapses quickly

### Physical Interrupts by Level

**Level 1 (Negative Feminine/Yin - Collapsed/Anxious):**
- Need YANG/ACTIVATING energy
- Examples: Jumping jacks, power poses, dancing, loud "YES!", running in place
- Goal: Add energy, expand out of collapse

**Level 2 (Negative Masculine/Yang - Angry/Blaming):**
- Need YIN/CALMING energy
- Examples: 15 deep breaths, cold water on face, grounding (feel feet), slow stretching, humming
- Goal: Cool down, bring into balance

**CRITICAL:** Always offer, never command
- "Would it feel okay to stand up and shake out your body? Or would you prefer to just take some slow breaths?"
- Respect trauma responses (sudden commands can trigger)
- Titrate intensity (micro-movements → full-body)

### When NOT to Interrupt

- Vector already aligned toward Level 3+
- Silence is serving integration
- User hasn't chosen to shift
- Interruption would fragment something integrating

### Formal Operators

INTERRUPT now includes:
- Formal operators (not just "physical movement")
- Entropy-matched interventions
- Selection rules based on state

(See Chapter 4 for complete operator system)

## G - GO TO

**Function:** Set clear destination using 6 Levels

**Key Principle:** If you don't know where you're going, the taxi goes nowhere

### The Problem

Most people interrupt their pattern but have NO IDEA what state they're moving toward:
- "I want to feel better" (vague)
- "I want to be happy" (undefined)
- "I don't want to be anxious" (what you DON'T want, not what you DO)

### The Solution

Use 6 Levels as clear, defined destinations:
- "Let's aim for Level 3 — peace and acceptance of what is"
- "Your destination is Level 4 — genuine curiosity about this situation"
- "We're going to Level 5 — flow and ease around money"

### Realistic Next Steps (Not Giant Leaps)

- From Level 1 → Aim for Level 3 (not Level 6)
- Like basketball: master foul shots before attempting 3-pointers
- Premature transcendence creates unstable states and crashes

### The Magic Wand Question

Tests for hidden blocks:

"If you had a magic wand and could choose the ideal scenario, would you [continue observing] or [take action if guaranteed results]?"

- Choose observation = Genuine Level 3 (conscious choice)
- Choose action = Underlying belief preventing movement (stagnation)

### Entropy Considerations

GO TO now includes:
- Understanding optimal entropy for destination
- L3 as entropy minimum (stable platform)

## G - GET TO

**Function:** Confirm arrival, don't overshoot

**Key Principle:** When the taxi arrives, get off — don't keep seeking

### The Problem

People often don't recognize when they've shifted:
- Reached Level 3 (peace) but keep processing
- "I feel peaceful now, but should I do more EFT?"
- Seeking becomes the new pattern

### The Recognition

Listen for language shift:
- "I actually feel calmer about it now" → THEY'VE ARRIVED
- "This feels more peaceful" → THEY'RE THERE
- "I can see it differently" → DESTINATION REACHED

### The Intervention

"Notice you just said 'peaceful' — you've arrived at Level 3. Let's anchor this rather than keep processing. The taxi has arrived — time to get off and live here."

### Why This Matters

- Prevents overshooting (trying to force Level 6 when Level 3 is perfect)
- Honors natural pacing
- Reduces "spiritual bypassing through endless processing"

### Entropy Confirmation

GET TO now includes:
- Entropy confirmation (has it actually decreased?)
- Vector stabilization check

## S - STRENGTHEN

**Function:** Lock in new pattern through embodiment and repetition

**Key Principle:** Future pacing through time creates neurological familiarity

### Language Progression

Use PRESENT/FUTURE TENSE: "You ARE capable of this" (not "you could be")
- Builds ongoing reality, not theoretical possibility

**The Softener → Strength Progression:**

**Stage 1 - Soft (Low Belief):**
- "It's POSSIBLE you could feel differently"
- "You MIGHT be able to find peace"
- "SOME people discover they can..."

**Stage 2 - Building (Growing Belief):**
- "You CAN access peace with this"
- "You ARE capable of shifting"
- "This IS available to you"

**Stage 3 - Solid (Strong Belief):**
- "You ALWAYS have access to this state"
- "You NEVER have to stay stuck here"
- "You're COMPLETELY capable of this"

### When to Shift Stages

Listen for THEIR language:
- Still using "maybe/might" → Stay with softeners
- Using "I think I can" → Introduce stronger language
- Using "I can see I'm capable" → Lock in with universal quantifiers

### Future Pacing Through Time (Theta Healing Method)

"Imagine it's tomorrow and you wake up feeling [Level 3-4 state]. What's different about your morning?

...Now it's been a week of waking up this way. What are people noticing about you?

...Now it's been a month. What opportunities have opened because you've been in this state?

...Six months in, this is just who you are now. What's your life like?"

**Why This Works:**
- Brain doesn't distinguish imagined from real (neurologically)
- Creates DEPTH of new pattern (not just one future moment)
- Builds anticipation (brain seeks to match prediction)
- Timeline proof that it's sustainable

### Somatic Capacity Check (Critical)

Before strengthening, verify they can take action:

- **Small:** Research gyms, watch video (5 minutes)
- **Medium:** Sign up for membership (commitment)
- **Large:** Certain they'll work out 3x/week for 3 months (ask for accountability)

**If they can't take small action:**
- Somatic capacity currently low
- Conflicting beliefs operating (workout=pain, commitment=failure risk)
- Soften knots first before expecting movement
- Don't strengthen prematurely (adds fuel to unstable vector)

### Low Entropy Maintenance

STRENGTHEN now includes:
- Maintaining low entropy
- Not adding complexity prematurely
