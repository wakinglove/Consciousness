# Chapter 7: Special Populations & Adaptations
*Pages 71-80*

## 1. Rapid Cyclers

**Borderline, bipolar, trauma survivors**

Traditional RIGGS assumes relative stability at each phase — rapid cyclers don't stay anywhere long enough. Need different architecture.

**The Approach:**
- Bottleneck = lowest level they hit
- Focus on frequency reduction (not level achievement)
- Lengthen time at Level 3+ (not reach Level 6)
- Use SET PROCESSES (not pure linguistics)

**Why:**
- If they agree to process upfront, they complete it
- Linguistics alone = they get hooked at pivot points
- Process carries them through without negotiation

**Examples:** Theta Healing, EFT, Swish Pattern, guided audio

## 2. Trauma-Informed Adaptations

**For trauma survivors:**
- Sudden physical activation can trigger fight/flight
- Commands can feel like abuser's voice
- Power poses might feel unsafe (body shame)

**The Modification:**
- Always OFFER interrupts, never command
- "Would it feel okay to stand and shake your body? Or prefer slow breaths?"
- Name what's happening: "Your nervous system is activated. Let's give it a gentle signal we're safe"
- Titrate intensity: Micro-movements → small → medium → full-body
- Emphasize choice AS PART of the interrupt itself

## 3. Cross-Cultural/Linguistic Adaptation

**Challenges:**
- Tenses/quantifiers don't translate perfectly across languages
- Cultural norms around "I statements" vary
- External reference can be culturally normative (family/community)

**The Flexibility:**
- If something doesn't work in a language, let it go
- If one aspect works better, amplify it
- Spirit > Letter (always)
- Preserve essential pattern (external→internal), release specific mechanism

**Example (Chinese):**
- 我不能 might be politeness, not helplessness
- Context matters (linguistic pinging reveals true root)
- But 我可能可以 sets better flow regardless

## 4. Chronic Conditions (Permanent Physical Challenges)

**Question:** Is Level 5-6 while in constant pain spiritual bypass or mastery?

**The Both/And:**
- Pain IS real (honor physical reality)
- AND internal state can be sovereign (peace regardless)

**The Mastery Bar:**
- Consistently at Level 3-4 = Already masterful
- Physical can't always change
- Keeping doors open (not premature closure) = the work
- Spontaneous remissions possible at Level 3+ with belief in possibility

## 5. Neurodivergence Considerations

**The Balance:**
- External tools (medication, structure) can be used freely
- The trap is: "I can NEVER be free unless I take this" (Level 1)
- The freedom is: "I take meds AND I'm at peace with that" (Level 3)

**The Principle:**
- Medicine as tool ✅
- Medicine as only hope for peace ❌
- External support ≠ External reference

**The Adaptation:**
- Rapid level cycling might be neurological (not emotional)
- "Massive action" (Level 6) might look different
- External structure might be genuinely needed (not dependency)
