# Chapter 8: Modality Completeness Audit
*Pages 81-95*

## Using RIGGS to Evaluate Other Systems

### The 5 Checkpoints for Any Modality

1. ✅ RECOGNIZE — Identify current pattern/state
2. ✅ INTERRUPT — Break momentum effectively
3. ✅ GO TO — Set clear destination
4. ✅ GET TO — Confirm successful arrival
5. ✅ STRENGTHEN — Install and reinforce new pattern

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**
- GO TO = Where are we heading? (Level 3? Level 4? What's the target?)
- GET TO = Have we arrived? (Recognition of shift, celebration of landing, prevent seeking-more loop)

**Why GET TO matters:**
People often reach Level 3+ but don't recognize it. Keep processing/seeking when they've already arrived.

"I feel peaceful now, but should I do more EFT?" = Missed GET TO

The taxi arrived but they won't get off. GET TO = "Notice you're there. Anchor this. Stop seeking."

## Modality Analysis

### Highly Complete (4-5 checkpoints)

#### NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Identifies specific pattern/anchor/state
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Pattern interrupts, scratches (strong somatic)
- ✅ GO TO — Future pacing creates clear vision
- ✅ GET TO — Tests change ("Go back to memory — how is it now?")
- ✅ STRENGTHEN — Anchoring, practice in multiple contexts

**Why it works:** Doesn't rely on understanding (bypasses intellectual loop)

#### EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization)
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Targets specific traumatic memory
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Bilateral stimulation disrupts pattern
- ✅ GO TO — Installs positive cognition
- ✅ GET TO — Tests memory activation (SUD scale)
- ✅ STRENGTHEN — Body scan, homework assignments

**Why it works:** All 5 checkpoints naturally included

#### Theta Healing
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Muscle testing identifies beliefs
- ✅ INTERRUPT — "Pulls" and replaces beliefs subconsciously
- ✅ GO TO — Downloads specific new belief/feeling
- ⚠️ GET TO — Client asked to "feel" new belief
- ⚠️ STRENGTHEN — Depends on practitioner follow-up

**Result:** Highly effective, just needs better STRENGTHEN

#### 12-Step Programs
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Step 1: Admit powerlessness
- ⚠️ INTERRUPT — Abstinence (behavioral, not somatic)
- ✅ GO TO — Clear destination: sobriety, serenity
- ✅ GET TO — Chips/coins mark milestones
- ✅ STRENGTHEN — Daily meetings, sponsorship, service

**Result:** Strong structure, could improve INTERRUPT with somatic practices

### Moderately Complete (3 checkpoints)

#### CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Identifies automatic thoughts
- ⚠️ INTERRUPT — Thought challenging (weak, still cognitive)
- ✅ GO TO — Installs alternative thoughts
- ⚠️ GET TO — Sometimes acknowledged
- ✅ STRENGTHEN — Homework, practice logs

**More effective than talk therapy due to GO TO and STRENGTHEN**

#### Somatic Experiencing
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Tracks body sensations
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Titrated release, pendulation
- ⚠️ GO TO — Implicit (returning to regulation)
- ✅ GET TO — "Notice your breathing has settled"
- ⚠️ STRENGTHEN — Varies by practitioner

**Excellent RECOGNIZE, INTERRUPT, GET TO — could improve GO TO clarity**

#### EFT / Tapping
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Names specific issue
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Tapping disrupts energy
- ⚠️ GO TO — Often vague ("I deeply love and accept myself")
- ⚠️ GET TO — Sometimes rushed past
- ⚠️ STRENGTHEN — Usually missing daily routine

**Immediate relief that may not stick without reinforcement**

---

### Incomplete (1-2 checkpoints)

#### Traditional Talk Therapy
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Explores patterns, identifies wounds
- ❌ INTERRUPT — Minimal, mostly cognitive
- ❌ GO TO — No clear destination
- ❌ GET TO — No arrival confirmation
- ❌ STRENGTHEN — No integration protocol

**Result:** Years of understanding, same patterns

#### Massage Therapy
- ✅ RECOGNIZE — Identifies physical tension
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Physical manipulation releases tension
- ❌ GO TO — Doesn't address cause
- ⚠️ GET TO — Person feels released (partial)
- ❌ STRENGTHEN — No new patterns installed

**Result:** Feels amazing for 3 days, tension returns

#### Medication Only
- ⚠️ RECOGNIZE — Often bypassed
- ✅ INTERRUPT — Strong chemical intervention
- ❌ GO TO — No destination (just "reduce symptoms")
- ❌ GET TO — No arrival confirmation
- ❌ STRENGTHEN — Creates dependency

**Result:** Symptoms managed but no internal transformation

## How to Complete Any Modality

**Missing RECOGNIZE?** → Add pattern identification phase
**Missing INTERRUPT?** → Add somatic or energetic component
**Missing GO TO?** → Name specific destination using 6 Levels
**Missing GET TO?** → Create arrival confirmation moment
**Missing STRENGTHEN?** → Add daily practice and integration

**This transforms partial tools into complete transformational containers.**
