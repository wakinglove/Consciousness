# Chapter 6: Practitioner Self-Care & Regulation
*Pages 66-70*

## Quantum Entanglement Awareness

**What it is:**
- This isn't "taking on energy" (spiritual bypassing)
- This IS empathic attunement (information, not contamination)
- Self-awareness to notice it = sophisticated navigation

**The Practice:**
1. Notice when you're feeling pulled down
2. Name it: "I'm noticing Level 1 energy"
3. Regulate yourself (breath, grounding, micro-break)
4. Continue serving from Level 3+

**The Check:**
If you're "needing" their transformation → You've lost internal reference
- Your peace depends on their progress = External reference trap
- You can only give what you have
- If you're at Level 1-2, pause and return to Level 3 first

**The Honesty:**
Sometimes facilitators dip to Level 1-2 even knowing "better"
- This is human
- Checking your level doesn't guarantee you can shift it
- Best you can do: Transform energy to best ability NOW
- Get support when needed

**The Permission:**
If you're stuck at Level 1-2 as facilitator:
- Refer client temporarily
- Do your own work first
- Be honest: "I'm noticing I'm dysregulated — let's pause"
- Protects both people
