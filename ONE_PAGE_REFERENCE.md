# RIGGS + 6 Energy Levels — ONE PAGE OPERATOR REFERENCE

## The Core Principle
**Detect marker → Apply implied operator → Reduce entropy → Exit when coherence returns**

---

## HIGH ENTROPY ZONE (L1-L2) — Instability

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Collapse (L1)** | "I can't..." / "Nothing works" / Helpless | **Grounding Interrupt (GI)** | Somatic anchor (feet/breath), past tense, NO fixing |
| **Resistance (L2)** | "They always..." / Blame / External | **Cooling Interrupt (CI)** | Slow breath, normalize emotion, redirect inward |
| **Recursion** | "I'm bad at being bad at this" / Meta-loops | **Recursion Collapse (RC)** | Strip symbolism, immediate somatic reset |
| **Analysis** | "I understand but..." / No action | **Somatic Reset (SR)** | Body movement, reduce language, ONE present-moment question |

**Target:** Return to L3 (low entropy baseline)

---

## LOW ENTROPY ZONE (L3-L5) — Coherence

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Stability (L3)** | "It is what it is" / Present calm | **Hold / No-Op (H)** | Reflect only, silence OK, NO pushing |
| **Curiosity (L4)** | "I wonder..." / "What if..." | **Micro-Guidance (MG)** | Small experiments, choice questions, NO pressure |
| **Flow (L5)** | "This feels natural" / Action occurring | **Amplify (A)** | Extend what's working, match pace, minimal steering |

**Target:** Maintain or support natural progression

---

## VERY LOW ENTROPY (L6) — Autonomous Creation

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Mastery (L6)** | "I'm already doing it" / Identity statements | **Withdraw (W)** | Step back completely, logistics ONLY if asked |

**Target:** Protect flow, prevent dependency

---

## CROSS-LEVEL INTERVENTION

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action | Safety |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Rigidity** | "Must do this right" / No play / Tension | **Humor/Play Injection (HPI)** | Light exaggeration, gentle joke, permission to be imperfect | ONLY with strong rapport, NEVER at L1 |

---

## META-RULES (Operator Selection)

1. **Smallest Effective** — Don't over-intervene
2. **Resistance = Slow Down** — Switch A→MG→H as needed
3. **Silence Is Valid** — Most powerful operator is often NONE
4. **Humor Optional** — If in doubt, don't use
5. **Check Landing** — Did entropy decrease? Are they at L3+?
6. **Respect Timing** — L3 is COMPLETE, not incomplete

---

## ENTROPY MAPPING (Corrected)

| Level | Entropy | State |
|-------|---------|-------|
| L1 | Very High | Fragmented, trapped |
| L2 | High | Misaligned, oscillating |
| **L3** | **Low** | **Stable baseline (target)** |
| L4 | Low | Organizing, structuring |
| L5 | Low (less waste) | Converting to action |
| L6 | Very Low | Frictionless flow |

**Key:** L3→L4→L5→L6 = Entropy CONTINUES decreasing, organized complexity increases

---

## ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Detect marker → Apply operator → Reduce entropy → Exit when coherence returns**
