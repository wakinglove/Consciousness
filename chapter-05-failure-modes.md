# Chapter 5: Critical Failure Modes & Safeguards
*Pages 56-65*

## Six Common Practitioner Errors

### 1. Vector Hijacking

**What it is:**
- Practitioner with strong Level 5-6 energy overrides client's emerging vector
- Client moves but not from self-choice
- Relief followed by dependency

**Early Signals:**
- Rapid compliance without processing
- "I feel better when I talk to you" (external reference to practitioner)
- Excessive agreement
- "Good student" energy

**The Safeguard:**
Ask consent-checking questions:
- "Does this actually feel true in your BODY, or does it just make intellectual sense?"
- "Are you agreeing because you want to, or because it seems like the 'right' answer?"
- "Would you choose this even if I weren't here?"

**The Principle:** Vector ownership must be tested before amplifying momentum.

### 2. Spiritual Bypassing

**What it is:**
- Operating linguistically at Level 4-5
- But revealing Level 1-2 restrictions when specifics arise
- Using spiritual language to avoid action

**Example:**
"I'm so grateful for this growth opportunity [sounds Level 4]... but I can't actually apply for that job because Mercury is retrograde and my nervous system needs to integrate first [reveals Level 1-2]"

**The Detection:**
- High-level language about CONCEPTS
- Low-level language about SPECIFICS
- Sudden complexity when action is discussed

**The Intervention:**
Use "magic wand" question:
"If guaranteed resources and results, would you take action?"
- If yes → Somatic capacity issue (work with smaller actions)
- If no → Choice clarity issue (honor where they are)

**The Utilization:**
If Mercury retrograde is "law," work WITHIN it:
"Since retrograde is about cleanup, would you be open to clearing anywhere you're not yet ready so when Mercury goes direct, you can shoot out like a rocket?"

### 3. Meta-Pattern Recursion

**What it is:**
- Using framework awareness to create new layer of same pattern
- "I'm at Level 1 about being at Level 1"
- "It sucks that I keep dropping to Level 2!"
- Framework becomes another thing to "fail" at

**Why Linguistic Solutions Fail:**
- Can't think your way out of thinking problem
- Same pattern using new content (RIGGS vocabulary)
- Still in the level, just with new language

**The Solution:**
RECURSION COLLAPSE operator:
- Physical interrupt (physically, not cognitively)
- Don't try to talk them out of recursion
- Physical interrupt breaks the loop entirely
- THEN use Level 3+ questions

**After Physical Interrupt:**
"If it was possible for you to accept this, what would that feel like? And what was the process/action/trajectory that allowed it to happen?"

**Why This Works:**
- Presupposes possibility ("if it was possible")
- Activates somatic future memory ("what would that feel like")
- Past tense = already accomplished ("what WAS the process")
- Brain constructs future to answer, already accessing it

### 4. Premature Strengthening

**What it is:**
- Rushing to universal quantifiers before person is stable
- "You ALWAYS have access to peace!" (but they felt it for 30 seconds)
- Creates cognitive dissonance and collapse

**The Protection:**
Use softener progression:
- Possible → Can → Always

Only strengthen when THEIR language shows readiness:
- If they're still using "maybe," don't jump to "always"

**The Check:**
Can they take micro-action aligned with the state?
- If not → Don't strengthen yet
- Strengthen premature = fuel added to unstable vector = crash

### 5. Level Shaming

**What it is:**
- Using framework to subtly judge or control
- "You're operating from Level 2 right now" (said with superiority)
- "Real masters don't drop to Level 1"
- Creating moral hierarchy with levels

**The Harm:**
- Creates shame (drops person to Level 1)
- Weaponizes the framework
- Violates "fellow souls" principle

**The Protection:**
Use 3-part acknowledgment:
1. What's already good (acknowledgment)
2. What can be improved (gentle truth about current level)
3. When improved, what's possible (higher vision)

**The Metaphor:**
- Stagnant water (judgment that stays stuck) = bacteria
- Flowing river (acknowledgment that moves toward possibility) = life

**The Principle:**
One finger pointing out = three pointing back
If you're "level shaming," you're AT Level 2 yourself (judgment/blame)

---

### 6. Tool Worship

**What it is:**
- Framework becomes "the thing"
- Navigating the map instead of the terrain
- Identity formation around being "someone who uses RIGGS"

**The Safeguard:**
Frame everything as:
- Orientation (not truth)
- Training wheels (not permanent)
- Temporary scaffolding (meant to be transcended)

**The Reminder:**
Best teachers don't have most students — they develop most students into teachers

The goal: Framework makes itself obsolete through integration into formless artistry
