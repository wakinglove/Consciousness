# RIGGS + 6 Energy Levels: ONE-PAGE OPERATOR REFERENCE

## THE LAW
**Detect marker → Apply implied operator → Reduce entropy → Exit when coherence returns**

---

## HIGH ENTROPY (INSTABILITY ZONE) — INTERRUPT REQUIRED

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action | Target |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **L1 Collapse** | "I can't" / "Nothing works" | **GI** (Grounding Interrupt) | Somatic anchor, past tense, NO fixing | L3 |
| **L2 Resistance** | "They always" / "Unfair" | **CI** (Cooling Interrupt) | Normalize emotion, redirect inward | L3 |
| **Recursion** | "I'm bad at being bad" | **RC** (Recursion Collapse) | Strip symbols, immediate reset | L3 |
| **Analysis** | "I know but..." / Long explanations | **SR** (Somatic Reset) | Body movement, scope compression | L3-L4 |

---

## LOW ENTROPY (COHERENCE ZONE) — SUPPORT, DON'T DISRUPT

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action | Target |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **L3 Stability** | "It is what it is" | **H** (Hold/No-Op) | Reflect only, silence OK, NO pushing | Maintain L3 |
| **L4 Curiosity** | "What if" / "I wonder" | **MG** (Micro-Guidance) | Small experiments, choice questions | L4 or L5 |
| **L5 Flow** | "This feels natural" | **A** (Amplify) | Extend what's working, match pace | L5 or L6 |

---

## VERY LOW ENTROPY — PROTECT THE FLOW

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action | Target |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **L6 Action** | "I'm already doing it" | **W** (Withdraw) | Step back, logistics only if asked | Protect L6 |

---

## CROSS-LEVEL INTERVENTION

| Marker | Language | Operator | Action | Safety |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| **Rigidity** | "Must be done right" / No play | **HPI** (Humor/Play) | Light exaggeration, restore flexibility | Rapport required, NEVER at L1 |

---

## META-RULES

1. **Smallest Effective** — Don't use GI at L4 when reflection works
2. **Resistance = Slow Down** — A→MG→H as needed
3. **Silence Is Valid** — Most powerful operator is often NO operator
4. **Humor Optional** — If in doubt, don't use
5. **Check Landing** — Did entropy decrease? Are they at L3+?
6. **Respect Timing** — L3 is COMPLETE, not incomplete

## ENTROPY CHEAT SHEET

| Level | Entropy | State |
|-------|---------|-------|
| L1-L2 | HIGH | Fragmented, trapped, oscillating |
| L3-L5 | LOW | Stable, organizing, efficient |
| L6 | VERY LOW | Frictionless, optimal, flowing |

**L3→L4→L5→L6 = Decreasing entropy, increasing organized complexity**
