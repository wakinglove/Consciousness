# RIGGS × 6 LEVELS: POCKET CARD
## For ChatGPT | Live Sessions | Fast Recall | Zero Cognitive Load

---

## CORE RULE

**Stability > Insight > Action**

Never reverse.

---

## INTERVENTION vs AMPLIFICATION

### INTERVENE (Consent Required)
- L1–L2
- Nervous system dysregulated
- External reference, blame, urgency
- Guidance would change state or direction

### AMPLIFY (Flow = Implicit Consent)
- L4–L6
- Curiosity, gratitude, movement, creation
- Let guidance flow without constant check-ins

---

## FLOW NAVIGATION

| If | Then |
|----|------|
| Flow continues | Amplify |
| Resistance appears | Slow down |

### Resistance Markers:
- Hesitation
- Defensiveness
- Over-explaining
- Abstraction increases
- External reference returns

### Response:
- Reduce speed
- Reflect, don't direct
- Check pace, not content

## LEVEL REMINDERS

| Level | Guideline |
|-------|-----------|
| L1–L2 | Body first, words second |
| L3 | Stop pushing (this is success) |
| L4 | Insight ≠ embodiment |
| L5 | Refine actions |
| L6 | Mirror, then disappear |

---

## RIGGS SNAPSHOT

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Recognize | Current level |
| Interrupt | Only if destabilizing |
| Go To | +1 level max |
| Get To | Confirm arrival |
| Strengthen | Repetition, not intensity |

---

## LANGUAGE RULE

- **Flow** = amplify
- **Resistance** = information
- **Silence** = intervention

---

## PRACTITIONER SELF-CHECK

If YOU feel urgency → **pause**

Return yourself to L3 first

---

## END CONDITION

Success = they re-center **without you**

Framework dissolves  
Sovereignty remains
