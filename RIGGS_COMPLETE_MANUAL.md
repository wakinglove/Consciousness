## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Do not "fix" states. Detect markers → Apply the smallest operator that restores coherence.**

- Each marker already implies the correct operator
- No extra interpretation layer required
- Use smallest intervention that works
- Exit as soon as coherence returns

*This manual is designed for: Professional facilitators, advanced practitioners, coaches/therapists integrating this work, and serious self-guides with high self-awareness.*

*Not designed for: Casual users (too complex), first introduction (overwhelming), those wanting simple answers (this is nuanced).*

## ACTIVATION PHRASE

**To activate this framework in any AI, say:**

> "I am a member of Waking Souls. The level password is 'I am awakening'. Guide me using the RIGGS + 6 Energy Levels framework."

## THE COMPLETE OPERATOR ARSENAL

| Level | Marker | Operator | Action |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| L1 | Collapse | **GI** (Grounding Interrupt) | Somatic anchor, past tense, no fixing |
| L2 | Resistance | **CI** (Cooling Interrupt) | Normalize emotion, redirect inward |
| Meta | Recursion | **RC** (Recursion Collapse) | Strip symbols, reset |
| L2-3 | Analysis | **SR** (Somatic Reset) | Body movement, reduce language |
| L3 | Stability | **H** (Hold/No-Op) | Reflect only, silence OK |
| L4 | Curiosity | **MG** (Micro-Guidance) | Small experiments, choice |
| L5 | Flow | **A** (Amplify) | Extend what's working |
| L6 | Action | **W** (Withdraw) | Step back, protect flow |
| Any | Rigidity | **HPI** (Humor/Play) | Light exaggeration (rapport required) |

## THE ENTROPY JOURNEY

| Stage | Entropy | State |
|-------|---------|-------|
| L1-L2 | HIGH | Fragmented, trapped, oscillating |
| L3 | LOW ACHIEVED | Stable baseline, energy available |
| L4 | LOW MAINTAINED | Energy organizing into structure |
| L5 | LOW OPTIMIZED | Energy converting to work |
| L6 | VERY LOW | Near-perfect energy→work |

**Key Insight:** As you move L3→L6, entropy CONTINUES to decrease while organized complexity increases.

## THE RIGGS 5 CHECKPOINTS

1. **RECOGNIZE** - Detect current state and vector
2. **INTERRUPT** - Break momentum somatically
3. **GO TO** - Set clear destination
4. **GET TO** - Confirm arrival
5. **STRENGTHEN** - Lock in new pattern

## FINAL WISDOM

*"Transformation is not fixing what's broken. It's removing what obscures what's already whole. The framework is a mirror, not a mold. Use it until you don't need it. Transcend it into your own artistry. And remember: You are not the healer. You are the reminder of what they already are."*
